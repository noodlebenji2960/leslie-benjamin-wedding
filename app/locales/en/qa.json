    },
    {
      "question": "What will the weather be like?",
      "answer": "July is usually very sunny ☀️ and warm. Expect daytime temperatures around 25–30°C, with cooler evenings once the sun goes down. Rain is unlikely, but we recommend bringing a light layer just in case for the evening."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where should I park?",
      "answer": "Why take the car!? Don't do that. There will be a bus from Fuente Murrieta in Logroño to the Hotel! But if you don't plan on drinking and really want to take the car, there is free parking available at the venue."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are the ceremony and reception locations wheelchair accessible?",
      "answer": "Yes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I wear?",
      "answer": "Not white. Something light and bright and comfortable shoes for a warm day. It can cool down in the evening, so a light jacket or wrap might be useful. Most importantly, wear something you’ll be happy dancing in 💃🕺"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the wedding indoors or outdoors?",
      "answer": "Both! The ceremony will be outside, followed by cocktails. Dinner will be indoors, so you can enjoy the sunshine and then settle in comfortably for the evening 🌿✨"
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of shoes should/shouldn't I wear?",
      "answer": "Skip stiletto heels — there are grassy and dirt areas to walk across. Bigger heels, wedges, flats, or sandals will be much more comfortable (and safer!). We’d hate for anyone to ruin beautiful shoes or spend the night worrying about their ankles."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it okay to take pictures with our phones and cameras during the wedding?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Feel free to snap away, but we do have a professional photographer and a photobooth to capture all the special moments 📸 Please be mindful of flashes during the ceremony so everyone can enjoy the moment."
